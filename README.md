# D2L
I use to store the code for deep learning

1) for Attention score, it's logic is like below picture
   

2) for seq2seq by encoder and decoder it's struct like below
    but i still have a query: why use state[-1] 


3) Attention + seq2seq struct like below


4) When using RNN,GRU,LTSM we have a param num_layer, i cannot understand but below image explain:
    <img src="C:\Users\50588\Desktop\深度学习代码\image\numer_layer.png"/>


Below are some useful guide for DL
